<p>
One of the most powerful techniques is proof by induction.
</p>

<italic>(Do not confuse mathematical induction with inductive or deductive reasoning. Despite the name, mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning.)</italic>

<p>
Let's say, we want to prove that some statement \(P\) is true for all positive integers. In other words:
</p>

<p>
\(P(1)\) is true, \(P(2)\) is true, \(P(3)\) is true&#x2026; etc.
</p>

<p>
We could try and prove each one directly or by contradiction, but the infinite number of positive integers makes this task rather grueling. Proof by induction is a sort of generalization that starts with the basis:
</p>

<p>
<b>Basis:</b> Prove that \(P(1)\) is true.
</p>

<p>
Then makes one generic step that can be applied indefinitely:
</p>

<p>
<b>Induction step:</b> Prove that for all \(n\geq1\), the following statement holds: If \(P(n)\) is true, then \(P(n+1)\) is also true.
</p>

<p>
See what we did there? We've devised another problem to solve, and it's seemingly the same. But if the basis is true, then proving this <i>inductive step</i> will prove the theorem.
</p>

<p>
To do this, we chose an arbitrary \(n\geq1\) and assume that \(P(n)\) is true. This assumption is called the <i>inductive hypothesis</i>. The tricky part is this: we don't prove the hypothesis directly, but prove the \(n+1\) version of it.
</p>

<p>
This is all rather amorphous, so let's prove a real theorem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theorem 1.</b> For all positive integers \(n\), the following is true:
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

<p>
<b>Proof</b>. Start with the basis when \(n\) is \(1\). Just calculate it:
</p>

<p>
\[ 1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}. \]
</p>

<p>
This is correct, so, the basis is proven. Now, assume that the theorem is true for any \(n\geq1\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{equation}

<p>
In the induction step we have to prove that it's true for \(n+1\):
</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n+1) = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
\end{equation}


<p>
Having this equation, we should just try to expand it and prove directly. Since the last member on the left side is \(n+1\), the second last must be \(n\), so:
</p>

<p>
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n + (n+1) \]
</p>

<p>
From our assumption, we know, that
</p>

<p>
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}. \]
</p>

<p>
So, let's replace it on the right hand side:
</p>

<p>
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) \]
</p>

<p>
And then make that addition so that the right hand side is a single fraction:
</p>

<p>
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n + 1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{2(n+1)}{2} \]
</p>

<p>
\[ = \frac{n(n+1) + 2(n+1)}{2} \]
</p>

<p>
\[ = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}. \]
</p>

<p>
Done, we have proven that the inductive step (\ref{eq:3}) is true.
</p>

<p>
There are two results:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The theorem is true for \(n=1\).</li>
<li>If the theorem is true for any \(n\), then it's also true for \(n+1\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Combining these two results we can conclude that the theorem is true for all positive integers \(n\).
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I had troubles with this technique because for a long time I couldn't for the life of me understand why is this <i>enough</i> and how is the basis <i>helping</i>?! The basis seemed redundant. We assume \(P(n)\) is true, then prove that \(P(n+1)\) is true given that \(P(n)\) is true, but so what? We didn't prove the thing we assumed!
</p>

<p>
It clicked after I understood that we don't have to prove \(P(n)\), we just take the concrete value from the basis and use it as \(n\). Since we have a proof of \(P(n+1)\) being true <b>if</b> \(P(n)\) is true, we conclude that if \(P(1)\) is true, then \(P(1+1)\) is true.
</p>

<p>
Well, if \(P(1+1)\) is true, then, using the same idea, \(P(1+1+1)\) is true, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The basis was the cheat-code to kick-start the process by avoiding the need to prove the assumption \ref{eq:2}.</p>
